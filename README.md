# NLTK-Workshop
The resources in this repository support the Berkeley DLab's September 29, 2015 workshop on Python and NLTK.

The workshop is designed with two goals. First, we will follow-up on Professor Thornburyâ€™s talk, by looking at some of the tools she discussed in her research, including concordance building and basic statistics. Second and more broadly, the workshop will offer a (very gentle) introduction to programming in Python, which is a popular language in DH and many other fields. Absolutely no previous knowledge of programming is required, and we will use the workshop to establish a knowledge base for the rest of the semester.

The Python script that forms the backbone of this workshop is in the Jupyter Notebook format and requires the NLTK package, as well as the NLTK_DATA corpora.

-Jupyter and NLTK are can be downloaded as part of the Anaconda platform here: https://www.continuum.io/downloads. (Select the version for Python 2.7)

-NLTK_DATA can be installed by opening the notebook "test-script.ipynb" and running the second cell.
